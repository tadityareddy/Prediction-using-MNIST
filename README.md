# Prediction-using-MNIST
This GitHub repository contains code for predictions made on a deep learning model trained on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits, commonly used as a benchmark for image classification tasks.

The deep learning model used in this repository was trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which has been shown to be highly effective for image classification tasks. The model was trained on a subset of the MNIST dataset, consisting of tens of thousands of images, to learn the patterns and features that distinguish different digits.

The code in this repository allows users to load the trained model and use it to make predictions on new, unseen images of handwritten digits. The predictions are based on the probability that each image belongs to each of the ten possible digit classes (0-9), and are returned as a list of probabilities. The code also includes functions for visualizing the input images and the model's predictions.

Overall, this repository provides a useful tool for anyone interested in working with the MNIST dataset or using a pre-trained deep learning model for digit recognition tasks. With clear documentation and an easy-to-use interface, users can quickly and easily apply this model to their own projects and datasets.
